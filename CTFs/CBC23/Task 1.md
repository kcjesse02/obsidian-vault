#### Challenge Description
The US Coast Guard (USCG) recorded an unregistered signal over 30 nautical miles away from the continental US (OCONUS). NSA is contacted to see if we have a record of a similar signal in our databases. The Coast guard provides a copy of the signal data. Your job is to provide the USCG any colluding records from NSA databases that could hint at the objectâ€™s location. Per instructions from the USCG, to raise the likelihood of discovering the source of the signal, they need multiple corresponding entries from the NSA database whose geographic coordinates are within 1/100th of a degree. Additionally, record timestamps should be no greater than 10 minutes apart.

- find coordinates matching within 01/100 precision.
- No greater than 10 minutes apart
	- no individual blips

##### Intro
- we are given a `database.db`file for the db of signals
	- a database file common in embedded devices and phones
	- can be examined with SQLite
- and a `USCG.log` file for the thing we are supposed to search for
	- in a JSON format (I think)

### My Solution(??)
- Use sqlite to query the table! (databases memoment)
	- there is a python api! We can just write a python script
	- https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#
- Use the python Json library to convert the log file into a python dictionary
- extract the longitude and latitude and create upper and lower bounds

##### A Roadblock
- I tried to filter for correct long and lat values in the database. This proved to be difficult to debug. I then just got the values from the 
- Another thing: I think floats need to be the same precision to be equal in python. Nothing came up when I rounded the upper and lower bounds to two decimal places

### Code
`db_search.txt`
```python
import sqlite3
import json

conn = sqlite3.connect("database.db")
cur = conn.cursor()

fp = open("USCG.log")
uscg = json.load(fp)

# setting up the searching parameters
lat = float(uscg["coordinates"][0]["latitude"])

lat_upper = lat+0.1
lat_lower = lat-0.1
print(f"{lat_upper} {lat_lower}")

long = float(uscg["coordinates"][0]["longitude"])

long_upper = long+0.1
long_lower = long-0.1
print(f"{long_upper} {long_lower}")


res = cur.execute(f'''SELECT L.id, recDate, recTime, longitude, latitude
                        FROM location L 
                        JOIN timestamp T ON L.id = T.id 
                  ''')
records = res.fetchall()

for x in records:
    xLong = float(x[3])
    #it turns out that just searching for longitude was enough to get the correct records
    if (xLong >=long_lower and xLong<=long_upper):
        print(x)
