- Textron Opportunity
	- Addy Reached out to us about that at the end of the term we should email her to set this up.
	- Will Sept. 26th work for the date?
- Things for Next Year
	- CTFs
		- I want to get the club more involved in CTFs next year
		- We should designate someone to find CTFs for us to do! (Like WiCyS)
		- We should advertise CTFs to more people. Muffin Mob channel shouldn't be locked behind a role I think.
			- We can test this with CodeBreaker challenge??
	- Keeping Documentation
		- Keep writeups to past ctfs in a github repo
		- Can include presentations and examples for member presentations
		- Prof Dai recommended that we do this + CMU does this
	- Reaching Out to New Security Professors
		- Welcoming them and describing our club to them
		- WiCyS is doing this and its a good idea, we should do it too!
