Hi Everyone,

We have a lot of events coming up, so we just wanted to give you a run down of everything!

**4/11: Judging baseball poetry**
We will be judging entries for a Worcester Baseball Poetry Festival! This is something our advisor, Prof. McIntyre, brought to our attention a little while ago. The competition is for K-12 students in Worcester, so there will likely be a lot of adorable poems that we get to read. This is a really great opportunity for community service! If you are part of an organization that requires/records member community service hours, Prof. McIntyre communicated that she would be happy to sign any papers. 

**4/18: Workshop Meeting**
Like last term, this is a meeting to bring existing writing that you want feedback on! We will break into groups and take turns sharing and giving feedback to eachother's writing within the group. *This is a great opportunity to preapare pieces for...*

**4/27 Open Mic Night**
Just like previous terms, this is an opportunity to share more finished pieces in front of an audience. You aren't required to share anything, so feel free to come and listen to other people's writing! There will be tea and, now, Profs McIntyre and Aguilar have offered to bring snacks!!
