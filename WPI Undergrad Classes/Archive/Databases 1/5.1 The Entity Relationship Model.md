## Database Design Stages
1. Application Requirements
2. Conceptual Design
	1. **ER Model**
	2. diagram based off of requirements for application
3. Logical Design
	1. Relational Model
4. Physical Design
	1. tables in DBMS

# ER Model
![[Screenshot 2023-09-14 at 1.24.18 PM.png|600]]
- Consists of entities and relationships
- A database can be modeled as a collection of entities (relationship)
**Entity**: an object that exists and is distinguishable from other objects

- oval represents attribute
- rectangle is an entity set (relation)
- diamond represents a relation

### Attribute Types
- Primitive attribute: comprised of one value
- Composite attribute: comprised of multiple attributes, address
- Multivalued attribute: attributes with multiple values, double circle
- Derived Attribute: Determined from the value of other attributes (ex: age calculated from DOB), dotted circle

### Relationships with attributes
- sometime it can be difficult to determine where attributes should go!

#### Ex 1
Suppliers have a name and location
Products have a name, price, and number
Consumers have a name, and location

Suppliers supply products at a certain date
Consumers buy products at certain quantities

Here is the ER model

If supplies and buys are not tables, where do the quantity and date attributes go?

#### Ex 2
Suppliers have a name and location
Products have a name, price, and number
Consumers have a name, and location

Some suppliers have established contracts to supply a certain Product to a particular consumer at a specific negotiated price

if we have a multi-way relationship, try to simplify it so only two tables are related at once:

**Recursive Relationship**: if two entities in the same entity set have a relationship
