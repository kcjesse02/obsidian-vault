Hi Karen,

Thank you for reaching out to us. Kai and I will be able to attend this meeting, but unfortunately Thei has a prior commitment.

Is there any problem that should impact our IRB approval? We received an email from Ruth McKeogh on the 15th providing approval with a note to add an interview agreement of consent, which we added. We are currently conducting interviews and accepting survey responses, so if we need to stop those activities, please let us know ASAP.

Thanks,
Katherine Jesse
