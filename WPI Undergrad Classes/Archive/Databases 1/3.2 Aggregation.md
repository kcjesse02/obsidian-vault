## Aggregate functions
Possible aggrgation functions in sql
- COUNT
- COUNT(\*)
- MAX
- MIN
- MEDIAN
- MEAN
- MODE

## Group By
- used with the aggregation functions

```sql
SELECT pNumber, name, MAX(classSize) AS max
FROM Professors
GROUP BY pNnmber
```
checks the MAX class size for each professor

### Restrictions of Group BY
- you must specify all non-agregate columns in the group by statement
	- even if you don't use it in an aggregate function
```sql
SELECT pNUmber, address, count(sName) AS CNT, sum(sNumber) as SUM
FROM Student
WHERE sNumber > 1
GROUP BY pNumber, address
```
ex: address is not used in an aggregate function


## HAVING Clause
- applied after `GROUP BY`
- adding conditions after group by has been applied
- cannot use aliases in HAVING statement
```sql
SELECT pNUmber, address, count(sName) AS CNT, sum(sNumber) as SUM
FROM Student
WHERE sNumber > 1 --before grouping
GROUP BY pNumber, address
HAVING sum(sNUMBER) > 3; --after grouping
```


## Ordering of Clauses
- Select
- From
- Where
- Group by
- Having
- Order by
