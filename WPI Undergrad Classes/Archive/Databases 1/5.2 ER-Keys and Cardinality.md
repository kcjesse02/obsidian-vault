- key of an entity-set: set of attributes that uniquely identifies each entity
WPI Student -> StudentID
US Student -> UniID, StudentID
- key has to be unique within the scope of your application

Candidate Key: Minimal super-key, cannot remove any attribute to be able to uniquely identify set member

Primary Key: The candidate key that the developer has choosen to use!
- when possible, use a singleton attribute

The problem with multi-attribute primary keys
- can sometimes prevent duplicates if you choose wrong items

## Keys for Relationships
- some relationships can have attributes that end up being part of the primary key
- the primary key of the relationship is the union of the keys for the members of the relationship, with the determinants.
- **Determinants**: internal keys of the relationship
