- How do measurements and pitfalls relate to each other.
	- measures talks about security measures
	- pitfalls talk about security vulnerabilities and shortcomings
	- it is hard to talk about designs without critiquing them at the same time, because some mistakes are so obvious.

- Some sections have evaluations, some only list things
	- they are also in weird order
- What anti-glitching measures did CMU enable?
