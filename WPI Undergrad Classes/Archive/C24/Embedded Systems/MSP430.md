There are various subversions with slightly different hardware specs

MAB: address bus
MDB:Databus

Peripherials: 
Timer
32bit multiplier
usb
led
serial interfaces
adc


128KB flash (code storage)
- writeable under program control (program address space)
8KB RAM (+2KB for usb)

## Memory Organization
![[Screenshot 2024-01-19 at 9.06.06 AM.png]]

- RAM begins with 0x02400
	- implemented in 2KB sections
- Flash starts with 0x04400 and ends with 0x0FFFF

- remember: each peripherial has its own address
- use pointers to write to the different hardware devices
- How does the 32-bit multiplier (or any peripheral) know when to run?
	- It may have a control register that will run when it is set to 1

## Registers
#### Dedicated Registers
R0: Program Counter (20 bits)
- Holds address of next execution
R1: Stack Pointer (20 bits)
- Holds return address of functions
R2: Status Register (16-bit)
- flag information
- used for comparisons
R3: Constant Gen Register
- Used to generate constants]
- holds the constants

#### General Purpose Registers R4 - R15
- Data values being used by current or recent instructions
- Much more efficient than retrieving from RAM
- Compiler tries to maximize register use


## Peripheral and I/O Registers
- below 0x00FFF
- Peripheral Registers are memory mapped
- read/write from/to the reg address
- control the peripheral device or I/O
