I enjoyed your piece so much! It was full of action. I think the description of your characters movements contributed heavily to this. I think this passage ecapsulates the strength of your descriptions: "She snaked her leg around his calf, and with a swift jerk she pulled his body out breaking his balance and leaving him gasping in a heap on the ground."(pg 2). This is an interesting description and gives a good sense of pacing in time with the character's actions. Your descriptions in generally a vivid and original: "Map in her hand, she navigated through the trees, unseen, until she reached the clearing and spotted the cloudy blue pools below her." (page 4).

However, the dialogue felt exaderated and off-kilter, like the dialogue for a play. For example, "“Pity. I was aiming for your face,” she said, “but it appears I fell short.”"(page 1). I think this does a good job of characterizing Jules as a brave and strong person, but this dialogue felt a little rehersed, especially considering the context of the situation. Jules is still human and would likely be at least a little bit scared. I also felt like the dialogue had the same construction in the conversations between Jules and Daph. I felt as if their dialogue should be slightly more casual, even if they are talking about heavy subjects, since they are familiary with one another.
