Hi Katy,

I love how your story explores a common relatoinship between two people, roomates, and how their personalities can create conflict within their relationship. Overall, I loved Nancy's character, she felt like such a supportive friend and I grew attached as I got to know her. I loved the way you described her mannerisms and the speaking quirks you gave her: "Her eyes were focused on a small piece of newspaper that she had cut up, crumpled, and shoved in her pocket, and was now trying to smooth out." (page 1). I feel like we can infer so much of her personality and role as a character from this description of the newspaper!

However, before the turn when the main character discovers that Nancy's a smoker, there doesn't seem to be any friction between them. Even if they are best friends, this made this section rather uninteresting. I would love to see other examples of conflict between them. I think this could also be used to flash out the main character's trauma surrounding fire. I didn't feel the embodiment of the main character's trauma until the scene where Nancy is caught smoking and felt it was more summarised than described. Maybe Nancy asks if she can light a candle (or something relatively inoccuous like that) and the main character gets anxious? I think more scenes involving confict will allow you to flesh out both Nancy and the Main Character more.

Overall, I found your story and characters very compelling. I am excited to see where you take this work, and hope you explore these characters further in future stories.
