## ORDER BY
- optional clause to sort a relation
- defaults to ascending

```sql
SELECT * from Student
ORDER BY firstName, lastName;
```
- orders by first field, but if two fields are identical, will move onto the next.

## Handling NULL values
- WHERE filtering does not work properly if there are null values in the attribute we are filtering with
- you need to filter out the null values
```sql
SELECT sNumber
FROM Student
WHERE address is null
```

to filter out null values
```sql
SELECT sNumber
FROM Student
WHERE address is not null
AND address is '57 Buttonwood'
```
- do not try to use '= null' to check for null vals
