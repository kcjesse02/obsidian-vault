"Cece, grab Marie another sandwich will you?" Dianea said, untangling the squirming Marie from her bother, squealing with laughter. C3 got up from their perch in the grass and opened their chest, breastplate breaking its seal from their body with a hiss. 

Dianea wore a linen sleeveless dress, a mythical goddess in a greek fresco. Her arms shone a toasted nut brown in the sun. Soft arms holding her daughter. One might miss the calouses on her hands.

I imagined what such warmth would feel like, a blazing spark crackling up your nerves at the point of contact. A conduit between the shell of your body and your soul. No unreactive metal gaurding my soul from any interface with the outside world.

I was designed by Dianea. give an identifier of C3; C for caretaker and 3 to denote I was the third of my kind. If I so desired, I could find blueprints of every minute function of my vessel, understand how and why I was made the way I am.

Marie was birthed by Dianea. Developed in a process developed by centuries of evolution, a process Dianea did not need or care much to understand. It is a part of her and of the human race, as deeply religious as it is biological. Pinned down with these signifiers: morning sickness, seeing the baby's form in ultrasound, the pain of childbirth. Prior to modern medicine, almost 50% of women died in child birth, the price humanity paid for walking on two legs.
