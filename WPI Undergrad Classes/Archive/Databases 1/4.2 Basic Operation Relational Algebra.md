# Relational Algebra
- operations that operate on relations
- Based on Set or Bag theory
- some take two tables, some one
	- unary operators
	- binary operators

Projection:  $\pi$ (sql select) unary
Selection Condition: $\sigma$ (sql where) unary
Rename result: $\rho$ unary
Sorting: $\tau$ uniary
Union: $\cup$ binary (duh...)

- can be combined, just like operators in arithmetic

## Selection Condition
$$\sigma_{c}(R):$$

- uses letter $\sigma$
- $c$ is the condition on $R$'s attributes
- Select subset of tuples from R that satisfy selection condition of c

- can use AND, OR, and NOT

Example:
Relational Algebra:
$$\sigma_{A=3 \vee B=5} (R)$$
code:
```sql
SELECT * FROM R
WHERE A=3 OR B=5
```

## Extended Projection
$$\pi_{a_1, a_{2,}..., a_n}(R)$$
- a is the aliases

## Renaming
$$\rho_{s}(R)$$
- s is the new name

## Sorting
$$\sigma_{sortingoption}(R)$$
