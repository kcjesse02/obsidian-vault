Erika,

Your piece reminded me of a book I read a few years ago called "The Parable of the Sower" by Octavia Butler. I think that this is because you created this very hostile world for your story to take place in, one with so much strife and dangers for your main character. There are extremely tangible fears that she has to deal with that are sometimes difficult to read about. However, there is this lovely beautiful and compassionate core at the center of it. This makes it feel very important without making the story feel unnecessarily "edgy". I think this is also supported by the beautiful descriptions of the night sky, especially during the scene at Kira's apartment, as Qi Yingyue learns to love the thing that she is fighting against. The description with the reality of the story is such a wonderful juxtiposition. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.

I also love how you characterize Kira. Her dialogue feels so natural and distinct. And I love the blankets you give her throughout the story. I love how you show the reader her personality before giving the full information as to how Qi Yingyue sees her, what an outlander is in your world. 

However, I did find the concept of an outlander and the patrols that Qi Yingyue completes in the first part of the story, when she meets Kira. Is Kira inside an area that belongs to the pentagon? Why is she not supposed to be there? Is she breaking the law by being outside? Qi Yingyue's Father doesn't seem too concerned that she saw a person outside (relatively based on his other actions in the story, it doesn't seem like she is breaking the law for being outside).
While I do love that the story just plunges the reader into your world, some of these worldbuilding elements never seems to be explained.

Overall, Your story is already something so great, but I am excited to see what it can become! Good luck on your revisions!
