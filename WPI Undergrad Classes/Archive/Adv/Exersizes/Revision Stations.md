"We must do this again!" My Sister told me as she clasped y hands in hers. I nodded with a forced smile.

"Oh you know us," I said. "Always so busy with the twins!" That was sure to nudge her away. My Sister grimaced a little bit and looked over to them at the window. My Husband lined up by the door way with me, but the children strayed.

Malcolm and Vivian played by the window. They swung my curtains up and down, linen billowing as they moved their fingers across it. Echoing gurgles and squeals, the sound of a baby cooing down a long hallway, or a pod of whales, emanated from their mouths. The golden light illuminated their translucent skin and made them glow from behind the light fabric. They tore at my curtains, not breaking the delicate weaving but deftly clawing at them. They ran their sleek fingers over my ceramic swan-shaped vase full of white roses and baby’s breath, my Husband had gotten them for me, on the table in front of the window. They left a trail of mucus over the white porcelain. I wonder how the world must feel with hands covered in amphibious slime.

“Stop That!” I said. They paused and turned their heads, void eyes boring into me. I clutched the dainty, golden cross around my neck. How they scared me. “Come here and say goodbye to your cousins!” They never spoke a word, but I knew they understood me because they always did my bidding. They dropped the curtains from their hands, which were now covered in lavender spots, and came over to my Sister’s three children: Martin, Emma, and Frances.
