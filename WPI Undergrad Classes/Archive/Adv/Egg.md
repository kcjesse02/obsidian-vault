The one positive of family gatherings is that they always end. I lined my husband and the twins in the foyer to say goodbyes to my sister's family and saw her out with a false smile and clasped hands.

My sisters husband payed condolences to mine with a firm handshake. A slight downturn crinkle to his eyes, connection.
My sister cradled my hands in hers, so soft. "We must do this again!" I nodded and plastered on a smile in response.

"Oh you know us," I said. "Always so busy with the twins!" I stood in the foyer for what must have been five minutes, chattering about as I tried to nudge her away. My sister grimaced a little bit and looked over to them at the window.

Marcus and Vivian played with my curtains, linen billowing up and down as they moved their fingers across it. echoing gurgles and squeals, the sound of a baby cooing down a long hallway or maybe a pod of whales, emanated from their mouths. The golden light illuminated their translucent skin, made them glow from behind the light curtains. They tore at my curtains, not tearing them, but

Eventually they went off into the golden evening and I shut the door, breaking the band of light streaming through the opening to the outside.

The last plates were rinsed and placed in the dishwasher. Now the next thing I had to clean was the pot which I had made the soup. Bits of the broth, thick with tomato paste, crusted its insides.

*The end*
I brought my hand up high above my head, almost touching the ceiling fan, and shot it down across vivian's grey, translucent cheek. She opened her mouth hole and let out a visceral sound, biological as much as it was mechanical, squirming and clicking. 

Her brother let out a buzzing scream in response. Like some holy dril-bit whirring as it bore into me. He stared at me with his warped face.

His skin did not fold in anguish as it might for a human. The rubbery substance that formed him stayed smooth.
