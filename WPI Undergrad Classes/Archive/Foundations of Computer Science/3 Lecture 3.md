## Why Finite Automata
- simple way to model states and transitions
- used in automated devices: atms, elevators

## Quiz
We have a finite automata with a binary alphabet. How many arrows are coming out of each state?
- At most two!
- Exactly two if each arrow can hold one arrow.

# Regular Languages
- string is a finite set of symbols
- language is a set of all possible strings
- **Language is regular if a finite automaton recognizes it**

## Recognizing a regular language
- proof by construction: find an automaton that accepts the language

- starts and ends with the same letter
