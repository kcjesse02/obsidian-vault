### Species Recovery in the United States: Increasing the Effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act
- ESA (Endangered species Act) has proven to be effective, but there are so many species that are endangered and effeciveness has been proven to be limited
- This article goes over how we can increase effeciveness of the ESA

1. Establish and consistently apply a system for prioritizing recovery funding to maximize strategic outcomes for listed species.
2. Strengthen partnerships for species recovery by expanding collaboration among federal agencies, the states, and nongovernmental organizations and by developing incentives for private landowners.
3. Promote more monitoring and adaptive management for species recovery. Conduct targeted, efficient monitoring programs to assess species status and improve management strategies, and use adaptive management to deal with ecological complexity and uncertainty.
4. Refine methods to develop more objective, measurable recovery criteria based on the best availablescience.

5. Use well-established climate-smart conservation strategies such as increasing habitat connectivity and reducing nonclimate stressors; evaluate and consider using innovative climate adaptation strategies, including protecting potential future habitats, assisted colonization, and engineering new habitats.

6. Evaluate ecosystem-based approaches such as surrogate species and coarse ecological filters to develop methods that increase the efficiency of managing for recovery.

#### What is the ESA
- mandates the monitoring and listing of a species threat level
- defines protections for endangered species and their habitats
- **Main Goal:** Recover species in danger of extinction
- All federal angencies support the recovery of listed species

##### Path to recovery
- Fish and Wildlife services and National Maritime Fisheries Service identify species that are threatened
- species are added to the list
	- things that are considered
		- destruction of habitat
		- overuse by humans
		- diseases or predation on the species
		- existing protections
	- categories
		- endangered: in danger of extinction in significant portion of its range
		- threatened: likely to become endangered
		- open to interpretation on purpose
- triggers conservation and recovery action
	- when federal agencies actions are reviewed for approval, impact on listed species is taken into account
	- all people are not allowed to take the species (harm or harrass)
	- fed agencies need to report an accidental take of a species
	- FWS and NMFS create recovery plans for species
		- these define funding, habitat, and other actions
	- 
- species is delisted when its abundance indicates that it can survive on its own
	- evaluate species status in relation to its threats
	- three rs: resiliency, redundancy, and representation of populations

Other Species Monitoring Organizations:
- NatureServe; Natural Heritage Network
- list is more extensive than the ESA
- Evaluates in terms of rarity, threats, and trends
- rules are more strict
- Others
	- Union of Conservation of Nature
	- American Fisheries Society
- 


##### Issues
- conservation is most successful for animals people like (ex: bald eagle)
- only 2% of all species that have been listed were ever removed due to recovery
- ESA not keeping up with changes in threats to protected animals\
- But, the ESA has recovered more than 200 species
	- Most species listed have not been protected long enough to recover
- 


### Geography of Listed Species
- found Hawaii, Appalacian Mountains, florida and other gulf states
- california/medditerraniean climate regions
- pacific northwest
- hotspots consistent with trends since the 90s
- New areas:
	- Southern Mississippi
	- northern Arkansas, western kentucky
	- southern indianna and illinois
- plants are increasingly being added to the list
