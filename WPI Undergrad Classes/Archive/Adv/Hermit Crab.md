Dear Friend,

Braving the wild lands away from developed society is less grandious than one would have thought. Even compared to the little freedom we have back at home, it is stifling. We are confined to our moist observation tubes, leaving would surely mean a slow painful death, The parched land steals whatever moisture it can get. 

The creatures provide more than just a supply of academic      curiosity. Distant relatives of the lizards and mammals before the death of god, balloons of water reinforced with metal shells. They're so swollen with it that they can barely walk. Most of the time they just remain still, like shotput balls nudged in the sand. I can imagine what you'd say; you'd find it quite poetic. For these creatures, condemned to the evolutionary path of reliance on water, dedicate every scrap of energy to dragging their burden of life behind them.

I don't understand why you wish to remain in the sanctuary cities. There's so much beauty in the desolation of the wild, so much for you to paint. There's enough nothing that I know you could fill with your own artistic imagination while still gesturing towards its reality. I suppose that there aren't many opportunities for an artist to be granted permission to follow along an expedition, but that doesn't stop you from trying

I wish I could tell you more, but I have a pile of observations to enter into the records terminal. I'll be sure to snag an interesting specimen for you to paint (If my advisor allows it). I'll write to you again soon.

Love,
Olivera Flowers
