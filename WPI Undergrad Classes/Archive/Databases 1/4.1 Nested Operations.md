## Set semantics
- Union, intersect, minus
- Must be union compatible: have the same number of attributes and data types
	- in the same domain!!
## Bag Operators
- Union ALL, Intersect ALL
- Must be union compatible
- allows for duplicates
	- why would we want this?
	- library would want to know how many copies of a single book they want to have

# Subqueries
- select inside an insert 

take data that already exists
```sql
INSERT INTO Supplier(id, name)
	SELECT accID, accName
	FROM account
	WHERE user_type = 'Merchant''
```
- values keyword is removed
- selected data is placed into new table

For delete and update, SELECT statements can only be added in the WHERE clause
-  make sure to look at what you are selecting to make sure you are deleting or updating the correct thing

## Practice

Report output relation O for customer who have a loan and an account
```sql
SELECT D.customer_name, Num_Loan, Num_Acc
FROM (SELECT customer_name, count(*) AS Num_Acc
	 FROM Depositor 
	 GROUP BY customer_name) D
JOIN (SELECT customer_name, count(*) as Num_Loan
	 FROM Borrower 
	 GROUP BY customer_name) B
ON D.customer_name = B.customer_name
```
- count is the number of times that customer shows up in the table (how many accounts they have)
- how many accounts they have, how many loans

### Problems with nested query in WHERE
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Student
WHERE pNmber = 
	(SELECT pNUmber
	FROM Professor
	WHERE pName = 'Mike')
```
- pName is not a primary or unique key
- make sure that the selecting key is unique so only one value is returned
- or else there will be an error
- you can also use the IN keyword

**Pattern Matching**
```sql
SELECT sNumber, sName
FROM Student
WHERE pNUmber IN
	(SELECT pNumber
	FROM Professor
	WHERE address LIKE '%FL');
--prof lives in florida
```

Find the student taking the largest number of courses


# Process for creating complex queries
- state the problem to be solved in englush
- use pseudocode ot outlink query
- outline each subquery
- code the quesry starting the innermost query

- complex queries: avoid using many joins
- rule of thumb for database complexity: avoid more than three joins
