*Notes taken from the hardware hacking handbook*

Most of the time, we want to measure change in voltage across a capacitor. This will allow us to detect weather the data is in a low or high state
- if current change is low-to-high, we should see positive current flow
- if it changes high-to-low, we should see negative current flow.

Hamming Weight: the number of 1 bits in a data value
- power will be different for data of different hamming weights

voltage value vs hamming weight

voltage was measured from resistors off of Vcc

## Example
Scenario
- circuit xors each input byte with some unknown secret byte-long constant. Then, it uses a lookup table to transform that value
- (this is one round of AES?)

- we get different power traces for different bytes sent and we can use these to recover the secret key!![[Screenshot 2023-07-26 at 1.42.21 PM.png]]


### DPA attack
Why Power Analysis and not brute-forcing?
- Power analysis is useful when the output is not available.
- we can use power traces to guess the output
- can break larger keys because we gain confidence the more we test

### Leakage assumption
- we have to assume that the system leaks all known hamming weights
- In the example we are using, we only know the *total* power consumed and thus can only know the *total* Hamming Weight.

### DPA algorithm
*For one guessed byte*
```
diffarray = []
1 each key guess i of the secret key in range {0x00, 0x01, ..., 0xFE, 0xFF}:
    zerosarray = new array
    onesarray = new array
    2 for each trace d in range {0,1, ..., D-1}:
        3 calculate hypothetical output h = lookup_table[i XOR p[d]]
       4 if the LSB of h == 0:
            5 Append t[d] to zerosarray[]
        else:
            6 Append t[d] to onesarray[]
7 difference = mean(onesarray) â€“ mean(zerosarray)
    append difference to diffarray[]
```
1. iterate over all possibilities for byte guessed
2. loop over power traces for each guessed byte
3. generate a hypothetical output, the result that would be produced if the guess was correct hw_lookup(byte_guess ^ current trace)
4. look at the LSB in the hypothetical output
5. add to one_list if the LSB is one
6. add to zero_list if the LSB is zero

##### If the bit is incorrect
the mean of the one and zero list should be about the same. The difference between them will be close to 0.

##### If the bit is correct
there will be a power difference between where the LSB is one and where it is zero. The diff will be significantly greater than zero.

It is also notable that the surrounding of the incorrect bytes decreases

## Important Points
- Differential Power Analysis is a method to prune power trace data to identify the entry of correct vs incorrect key bytes.
