Hi Angie,

I loves the overall premise of this story, a discussion about the nature of good and evil between a child and a young adult/teenager. It was a simple but interesting story. This provides many opportunities for dialogue, which is clearly one of your strongsuits as a writer. The dialogue did such a good job of introducing your characters. Valacity in particular felt very vivid on the page. I love the way it turns into Ria mourning Nigan, the story changes tone in a sudden, but delightful way.

However, I felt you were cramming a lot of worldbuilding into this story that you didn't have time to fit into it. While leaving some things a mystery can hook the reader, there were many moments that felt as though they didn't pay off. For example, it is mentioned that Ria has some sort of magic powers. We know that she can't use them, but we don't know any other details of how they work. We know that they are part of some group of escaped children who were held captive and experimented on. The world you are trying to reveal to us feels too vast to be covered in this short story. I suggest adding more detail to the memories of Nigan, these are a natural place to put information about the mechanisms on this world you are building.

Your story was a joy to read and I am excited to see where you take it! I hope you use this world in other stories too because it is clearly very rich.
