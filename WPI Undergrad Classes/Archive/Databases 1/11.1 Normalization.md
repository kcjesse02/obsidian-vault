standard rules to group up data

# First Normal Form
- repeating groups have multiple entries for a single record
- individual tables cannot contain re

# Second Normal Form
- no partial dependancies on primary key
- a single attribute primary key is automatically in second normal form

# Boyce-Codd Normal FOrm
- Stronger form of NF
- all FDs are nontrivial and have primary or superkey on the left
Advantages
- garuntees no update anomalies
- no redundancy
- garuntees no deletion anomalies
Disadvantages
- original FDs are not preserved
- decomposed relations are lossy

# 3NF
Minimal basis
- remove FDs that are not minimal
- remove attributes on the left side that are not nesesarry
	- ex: BC -> A, but B* -> includes A, you can just remove A
- Basically, find a primary key for a subset of the data and split that into the

Prime FDs: right side of the functional dependency has an attribute that is part of the candidate key
- BCNF will not preserve all of the FDs if there are prime FDs
- 3NF
