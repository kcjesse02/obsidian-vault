- uses CRC as its mixing function **only to generate seed from random SRAM startup data** [[Mixing Functions]]
- How does it work? Is each entry a coefficient in the polynomial?
- how do I put in-text citations?
- XORing - negating benefit from taking multiple samples
	- concatenating values then hashing
	- Find paper on PRNG design
