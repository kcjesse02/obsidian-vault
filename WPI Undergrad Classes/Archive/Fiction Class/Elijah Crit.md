- Emmet is funny almost with how meticulous he is
- I love how we are placed in Emmet's perspective as the reader sees what a slob matt is
-
- A lot of time is spent reiterating how meticulous Emmet is. I would love to see some of that freed up to explore matt's character


Hi Elijah,

I loved your story! I particularly enjoyed how real Emmet;s discomfort with matt felt. During the lunch break scene, I really felt Emmet's disgust at this messy person encroaching on his space and just generally being rude: "I smiled toothlessly and nodded slightly. I was hoping he would just leave. Unfortunately, he sat down right next to me, with his food. It was two pieces of pepperoni pizza." (pg 4). Having to deal with a rude, clueless person is a part of the human experience and this scene really sums up what that feels like. 

I feel like a lot of time is spent describing how meticulous about his life Emmet is by displaying that through his various routines. I enjoy the detail that is put into these scenes and think they initally do a good job of introducing us to Emmet. However, not much time is spent discussing why he is like this. It is breifly mentioned that he has to take insomnia medication, maybe that could factor into his need for control. However, I feel like this could best be communicated through Matt's quirks. Matt's actions are broadly infuriating, probably infuriating to even non-meticulous people. Maybe something Matt does reminds him of someone from his past, or just another person who annoys him. Specificity in how Matt messes with Emmet will make the situation feel more alive to the reader.

I enjoyed your story! Thank you for sharing this with us!
