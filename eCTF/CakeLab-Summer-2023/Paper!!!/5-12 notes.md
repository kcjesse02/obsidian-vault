1. Timing Side-Channel Attacks
2. Clock glitching/fault injection
3. Software vulns/Logical Errors
4. flawed cryptography and insecure randomness

First two are unique to embedded because of physical access

Note: Found that we could get many flags from one vuln
- lack of privledge separation
- hardware has privledged and non-privledged mode

We want to make a table identifying different measures taken my teams.

Other thing: Build related issues
