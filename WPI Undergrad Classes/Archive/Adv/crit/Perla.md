Perla,

I get this wonderful Alice in Wonderland type of feeling from your story. You use the same core device as that story, you create this absurd world to reflect the absurdity of a real life system, being a student at WPI in this case. There is a lovely sense of humor throughout your piece. I love the Post Man and the band of lost students. They're both really relatable. The characters that your narrator encounters are so vivid on the page and cartoonish. It really makes the reader feel the confusion the narrator must be feeling. 

The red pastel is also a really great symbol and was utilized well as a reference to reality, in the same way the Ogawa would use her set of symbols to give the reader an idea of what is true in Revenge. Its presence really added to the ending. Making Stanley the GOAT was such a wonderful twist. and as you said in your notes, having an ending where "the protagonist doesn't win but also doesn't know that they lost" was really interesting.

The imagery in your piece seems a little unfocused, there is no common thread between all of the different characters and experiences your narrator has. I can see the intentionality behind this, for humor and to create an Alice in Wonderland type world. However, I think that for a story of this length it would make sense to choose a few key symbols. One thing that you could do is focus more on the red pastel as an image throughout your story.

Additionally, the thread with the great uncle seems to have been dropped. I understand why he was initially included (because he was supposed to be the GOAT), but the current ending works really well. If you are not particularly attached to him, I would remove the references to him and use the space in the beginning he occupied to delve deeper into the relationship between the narrator and Stanley. Why do they care enough to look for him?

Overall, good job and i'm excited to see where this goes!
