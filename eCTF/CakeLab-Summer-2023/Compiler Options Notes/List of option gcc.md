**Possible note about linker errors:** The same error occurs when you try to use a stdlib function like `gets()` with the -nostdlib flag


### Options that compiled

| option                    | what effect does it have on the code?                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| -fsanitize=leak           | option only matters for linking executables                                                                |
| -fsanitize=kernel-address | nothing, there is no linux kernel so it does not have an effect                                            |
| -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2       |                                                                                                            |
| -z noexecstack            | no noticable effect on the binary, only way to designate a section as nonexecutable is though the MPU                              |
| -Wl,-z,relro,-z,now       | has no effect on the produced assembly code since there is no relocation table                             |
| -fstack-protector         | works because it doesn't even attempt to add canary, need to specify ssp-buffer-size to have it set canary |
| -fPIE -pie                | none, no ASLR on cortex-m                                                                                  |
| -Werror                   | is still valid even with nostdlib                                                                          |
- all of the binaries produced appear the same. Only options that don't have an affect seemed to work.

### -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE

`-D` is an option that sets a macro
`_FORTIFY_SOURCE` is a macro

It probably works because it is checking the code not as a part of the OS, but on the level of the code
However, many of its features involves checking standard library functions (like preventing compilation with `gets()` and making sure format strings are set for `printf()`) and thus are not useful for embedded programming

| level | effect                                                                                                                |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | buffer bounds checking with `_builtin_object_size`, which is a function that determines the size of a piece of memory |
| 2     | buffer bounds checking and trapping code that has some other unsafe attributes (ex: format string vulnerability)      |
| 3     | adds buffer bounds checking with `_builtin_dynamic_object_size`, which allows for a non-constant size to be returned                                                       |

1. Would using `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE` help teams with buffer overflows?
