- Joins are used to combine tables together

# Cartesian Product/ Cross Join
- take each element of R1, and combine it with each element of R2

#### In SQL
```SQL
SELECT sName, pNumber
FROM Relation1 CROSS JOIN Relation2;
```

`tuples or RxS` = `tuples of R` * `tuples of S`

Student has 3
Professor has 2
The cross joined table will have 6

- we tend to use other joins more often

# Natural Joins
- uses the primary key to join tables

R has attributes Ar
S has attributes As

Attributes of the Naturally Joined (A) table will be the intersection of Ar and As

- automatically select attribute names that are the same
- What if one attribute is changes in one table, but the other isnt

associates the primary key with 


# Theta Join
- Cartesian Product with a condition
- can be a natural join

- only includes tuples where Attributes A and C are equal

- wow! can be used to omit the prof key from the resulting table

## Difference from Natural Join
- Natural Joins: Common col only appear once
- Theta: will appear twice
- Specify which table you are refering to (use aliases)

# Types of Joins

- **Inner Joins**: returns values that have matching values in both tables
	-  this is a Theta Join
- **Left Joins**: Return all records from the left table, and matched from the right
	- `LEFT JOIN`
- **Right Join**: Returns all records from the right, and matched from the left
	- `RIGht JOIN`
- **Full Join**: Returns all records if there is a matched attribute
	- `FULL JOIN`
