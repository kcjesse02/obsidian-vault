##### What is a View?
- An SQL query that we store in the database
- store the definition, not the results

**Why**
- 
- hide information

### How to

Creating a View
```SQL
CREATE VIEW myview AS (
--query for the data we want
)
```

query a view: like any other relation
```sql
SELECT view_name
FROM myview
```
- replaces the view name with the contents of the query
