Hi Daniel,

Your story felt fresh and funny. A teacher that teaches their students to cheat on exams is a simple, unique, and effective concept. The critisisms of testing culture in education throughout your story were clear and benefitted by your concept. I love how you seemed to connect this back to your experiences as a college student and I found many of the sections relatable. For example, I felt called out when you described your main character procrastinating by reading a manga chapter, then watching a reaction video to it.

However, I think you could achieve that relatable feeling better if you were more specific in some areas. For example, the conversation with the main character's mother was distractingly unspecific. No specific details about either of their lives are discussed. I think it would benefit this scene to add some more specific details about the character's life. Maybe instead of just asking about classes in general, the mother can ask about his specific classes. I also noticed that the beginning included a lot of summary, explaining the main character's situation. These details could be revealed in the conversation with his mom in a much more engaging and effective way. 

Another suggestion I have is to lean into the absurd with your descriptions. When I initially read this, I had a difficult time telling it was satire, since the descriptions and experiences of the main character are so relatable. I think this could be helped by making these relatble situations seem more stylized. I think this could be implimented in how you describ Prof Treport, or even the experience of test-taking itself.

I enjoyed reading your story and am excited to see where you take it! This was a super unique concept.
