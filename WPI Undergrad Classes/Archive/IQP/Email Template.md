Hi [name],

My name is Katherine Jesse and I am part of an on-campus IQP group studying Workday's impact on WPI. We are talking to members of different groups at WPI to get a complete picture of how Workday affects work and communication.

As a part of this, we want to understand how Workday affects [faculty/staff/students] at WPI. We thought that you would be a good candidate to interview because [reason].

We understand you are busy, but if you could spare thirty minutes for an interview, it would add so much to our IQP. If you are interested, here is a link to book an interview with us: https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/EnterpriseApplicationsinHigherEducationInterview@wpi.edu/bookings/

If you have any questions, please let me know!

Thank you and have a nice day,
Katherine Jesse
