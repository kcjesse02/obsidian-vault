Hi Mare,
I really enjoyed your story. All of the elements we discussed in class seem to work in tandem to produce a powerful story. Specifically, I think the characterization is strong. Sam is such a distinct and relatable character. It is clear through her thoughts, actions, and dialogue that she is lovably stubborn and so kind. The characterization of her as a knight in the beginning is very fitting. Dawn is also a compelling character, but not to the same extent as Sam. Although, I wish we got to see as much of her as we do of Sam. Sam seems like a living person, where as Dawn seems more like a typical trope of a shy girl. If Sam is a knight, then Dawn appears to be the damsel-in-distress. It would be interesting to see what Dawn brings to their friendship, how does she support Sam and show her own kind of bravery?

I enjoy the beginning. It starts off like a typical fantasy story and I expected it to go that way, but you revealed the reality of the story in such a compelling way. I particularly enjoy how Sam always seems to pick a fantasy name that is derivative of her real name. However, the beginning does approach summary, especially when you describe her adventures. This turned my interest away, especially because I expected this to be a typical fantasy story. I suggest you begin the story right as Samara is encountering the evil wizard and just draw that scene out a little more.

Overall, I really enjoyed your piece.
