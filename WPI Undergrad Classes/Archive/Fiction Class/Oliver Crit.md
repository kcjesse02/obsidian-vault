Hi Oliver,
I loved the topic of this story! Splunking is such an interesting topic that has lots of specific terminology and knowledge that you can have your characters interact with. As someone who does not really know anything about splunking, this was an interesting way to get a bit of an introduction to it.

This story involves a lot of dialogue, which is generally a good idea, as it can provide a lot of context to the characters relationship without necessarily needing to explicitly tell the reader anything. Using dialogue to characterize two best friends going on a splunking adventure is a good idea, but this dialogue between Josh and Charlie feels rather bland. Take this interaction when Josh initially gets stuck: "'Charlie, stop. We need to think this through' Josh said.  
'It’s all right. I’ll be back in a few seconds. I’m just gonna check out what’s up ahead' Charlie said. 'No, you always do this Charlie. Just for once, stop what you’re doing and think.''  
'Why are you getting mad at me, I’m not even the one who’s stuck.''"(pg 3). This feels like two business collegues rather than two friends in a dangerous situation on a trip. I feel like this conflict has the potential to raise the stakes even more if we know the specific dynamics of their friendship. I would love too see more of their mannerisms and unique ways of speaking come through in their interactions. 

I enjoyed reading your story and hope you find luck with revisions!
