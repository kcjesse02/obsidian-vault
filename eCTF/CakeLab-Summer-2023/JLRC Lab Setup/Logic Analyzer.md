- lets you measure multiple channels at the same time,
- only represents data digitally (1 or 0) you can modify the threshold
- 

**attacks**
- decoding uart data
- can be used to capture signals (replay attack)
- can be used to identify different ports of the uart(TX mainly)


## Pros
- automatically decodes protocols (including UART)
- cheaper, cheap ones can be as cheap $20
	- although good ones are about the same price as a decent oscilloscope
- measure more channels than oscilloscope
- UB used a logic analyzer to exploit weak entropy, maybe we can get some advice from them?

## Cons
- More difficult to use/set-up
- requires logic analyzer software
- can also be very expensive to have a good one
- cannot be used to observe analogue waves
