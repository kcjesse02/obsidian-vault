- allow for caps on amounts
- restrict what data can be paired with what
### Create Triggers
```sql
CREATE Trigger <name>
BEFORE | AFTER {Insert | Update | Delete [OF attribute]}
FOR EACH ROW | () --leave blank FOR EACH STATEMENT
WHEN (<condition>)
BEGIN


END;
/
```
#### Components
- Event: when the event occurs, the trigger is activated
	- Insert
	- Update
	- Delete
- Condition: If the condition is true, the trigger executes
- Action: the action preformed by the condition


Triggering times
- before the event
- after the event

granularities
- Row-level trigger: executes once for each row affected by the event
	- allows for you to access data relating to the items being affected by the event through `new` and `old` variables
- table-level trigger: executes once for each statement

EX
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER EmpSal
After Insert or Update on Employee
FOR EACH ROW
WHEN (salary > 150000)
```

For each row
- to access the old value that was updates, use the OLD variable
- use the NEW variable to get the updated value


## Example

Using select inside triggers
- should be one value variables
- each mapped into a `temp` variable
