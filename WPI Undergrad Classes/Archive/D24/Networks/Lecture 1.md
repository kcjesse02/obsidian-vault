## Course Objects
- Computer Network architecture
- Broad view of network stack and protocol
- 

### Internet
- the internet: Interconnection of multiple networks into one
- the Internet: World-Wide network that replaced ARPANET
#### What is it?
- Host or end systems
	- anything with an address
- Communication Links
- Packet Switches
	- routers (IP addr forwarding)
	- Link Layer Switches (ethernet mac addrs)
- Transmission Rate
- Packets
- Routes and Paths
	- Wifi and sometimes ethernet on PC or laptops
- ISPs
### Vox Video: What is the internet
##### Levels
1. First and Last Mile
	1. Texts we send, Wifi in home, school, office, cell towers
	2. Binary Data is represented as modulated frequencies of waves, pulses of electricity
	3. fibre-optic cables: laser pulses through fiberglass
2. Internet Hubs
	1. ISP routes messages between LANs
3.  Undersea Fiberoptic cables
	1. Under the ocean
	2. Human activity can break them
	3. this is comething that happens for smaller, less connected islands :(

##### Internet Disparity
1. "Red zones" are places where ISPs expect more cost than revenue when providing internet
### Protocols
- examples: TCP, IP
- A common format for messages between hosts
- Standards
- Distributed Applications

## Transmission Technology
- Broadcast: from one endpoint to all members of the network
	- A discord server
- Multicast: Communication to a specified group
- Unicast
- Point-to-point: two entities directly to eachother

#### Classification by size
- LAN: Local area network
	- 
- WAN: Wide-area network
	- like a country
- 

# Reading: Chapter 1

Four-layer model: 
-  Application Layer
- Link Layer
	- TCP Library
- Internet-work layer
	- IP library
- Transport Layer
	-  LAN library
	- divided into logical and physical layers as well

**data rate**: the rate at which bits are transmitted.
**Throughput**: refers to the overall effective transmission rate, taking into account things like transmission overhead, protocol inefficiencies and perhaps even competing traffic.
**bandwidth** can be used to refer to either of these, though we here use it mostly as a synonym for data rate.
**goodput** is sometimes used to refer to what might also be called “application-layer throughput”: the amount of usable data delivered to the receiving application.

### Packets
- Format for data to be transmitted.
- header: beginning of packet containing information
- usually contain an address, or some other designation of where to connect, depending on protocol
- Packet sizes can also be different for different protocol

### Datagram forwarding
- Ports and switches look at the addr in the header to determine where to send it

Hi Tech News,

We recently met to judge contest entries for our Spring Writing Contest and we have a winner!

Here is the winning entry: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H5gemnL-UanhPJfaXuMql95B0O6WqOZz3b2rFbaQvvs/edit?usp=sharing

Would you be able to publish this in the March 26th entry of the Tech News?

Thank you,
