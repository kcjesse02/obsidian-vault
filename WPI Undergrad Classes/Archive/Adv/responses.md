week 2

One point that Scott's essay that stood out to me was about setting up the possibilities for character to be rich enough to thrive in their own story: "I imagined, would be set many years later. The family would have to move differently, reacting to things both unmentioned and hinted at that had happened in the years since...Bobby and his mother... could now ... be explored in greater depth." (Scott pg 4). Ogawa's stories seems to bloom from inside one another. She creates a these vivid webs of interpersonal connections that almost beg to be expanded upon.

However, she takes this a step beyond just developing characters, and uses this as a mechanism to gain a grasp of truth in the worlds of revenge. For example, in Lab Coats, we know that the Doctor is not lying when he told the head secretary that he was stuck on the train because of a surprise snow storm, because that was an event present in the previous story. This constant of truth is also used as a reference point to characterize her relationship with the doctor. The narrator in that story makes a point that the reader can understand: "'I don’t know...He could be telling the truth. Freak snowstorms happen. You should check the weather report. If he was going to lie to you, he would have said it was a patient.' She doesn’t seem to be listening"(Ogawa 48). This constant is used to ground the centeral conflict of the story in something the reader is already familiar with. The train being stopped gives the reader some entry point to begin speculating about the intricacies of the conflict that plagues their relationship. 

The connections that Ogawa creates in her world also open up new possibilities for the reader to create their own connections. The dual natures of the head secretary and the ending of Lab Coats is reminiscent of Old Ms. J, which is connected to this story through the previous story.

week 3

Ogawa's Revenge is constantly growing and changing. The twisting narratives expand together like mold growing over a piece of fruit. This is opposed to traditional western stories that seem to move the character over a linear path. Ogawa seems to create her own language of symbols, and the greater story grows as these symbols accumulate.

These symbols that she cultivates can create an elegant way to characterize new characters and events introduced into the world. This element of her work is pointed out as a commonality between many writers who belong to collective cultures. He identifies the following about the writer Orhan Pamuk: "To Pamuk, a character isn’t even formed by an individual personality but by the particular situation and context the author needs her for" (Salesse). I believe in many of her stories, Ogawa will rely on this complex web of contexts to describe her characters, as opposed to showing notable traits and appearance.

As we get into the last few stories of revenge, Ogawa has built up a wide range of symbols and character. For example, in the story Tomatoes and the Full Moon, Ogawa grabs the reader's attention using the imagery of tomatoes, something that was introduced in the previous story, to note that that will be an important symbol to follow, as they are associated with the woman: "In the other hand, she held a basket brimming with something red"(Ogawa 109). We are alerted to this symbol by the title of the piece. But the tomato itself doesn't turn out to be that significant by itself. Rather, it leads to a returning character from The Little Dustamn: Mama. Here we see her story in a new light, intertwined with this new magazine author character. We get this image of Mama as this mysterious possibly-omnipresent author character. She leaves our magazine author so fast, she vanishes: "But when I completed the last lap of butterfly and pulled myself up on the side of the pool, she was no longer there. The deck chair was empty; the dog, too, had vanished."(Ogawa 122).

week 5

The best flash fiction is not just short, but incredibly efficient with the story it tells. Hermit Crab sturcture can help make the piece more efficient by communicating something within the very structure of the piece. 

I think "Book Club Dip" did this really well. The structure of the recipe felt like a containment chamber for the author's anger and heartbreak. It gets across this cultural need to present everything in such a calculated an orderly manner, even when you are in an incalculable amount of pain. The use of the recipe, along with the absurdity of the actions the narrator takes, makes it clear that this is a violent fantasy that the narrator is having.

In addition to showing how the narrator contains her rage, I think that this story is making a point about the culture which the situation takes place in. No one in this story seems particularly happy. The book club seems to be more about gossiping rather than actual reading, the husband is cheating, and the narrator is the only one who, in this alternate reality within her mind, can stop pretending like everything is ok. No one in this world care about genuine connection, but rather superficial things.

This story is filled with so many symbols associated with upper-middle class suburbia. I grew up in a generally well-to-do, cookie-cutter (white) suburb, so maybe that's why I resonate with this so much. The symbols, especially with the flashy cars and the ranch disguised as homemade dip. It gets across really well this obsession with the material. One touch that I think really contributes to this is when the narrator refers to her husbands trousers as made of "lying fabric". She makes other judgements generally reserved for sentient being about objects within the story, like with Diane's "tarty convertible". The recipe structure also meshes well with the emphasis on objects, which take the place of ingredients or cooking utensils in this recipe.
