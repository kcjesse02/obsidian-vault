Do you agree with Jeanette Winterson that this AI-generated story is "beautiful and moving," or do you agree with [Lincoln Michel's assessment](https://canvas.wpi.edu/courses/69144/files/7421901?module_item_id=1279556) that this story is "flat," plot-free, and full of "purple prose" (or do you have a different take altogether)?

Form an argument. Support your claims with evidence from the text. Be specific.

The thing that struck me about Machine-Shaped Hand upon reading it is how dead it felt. It demonstrates Chiang's assessment that, when generating a creative work, the AI "fill(s) in for all of the choices that you are not making". One of the greatest joys about reading good writing is specificity. This story completely lacks that, and I would argue that is by design. 

A great writer will introduce you to experiences you've never felt before. I have a friend who writes a lot about going Lobster-Catching with his grandfather when he was young. There is a clear experience with the technicalities and sensory experiences of Lobster-Catching. There is an interwoven map of meanings and feelings within these stories. He injects it with his specific identity.  What do these memories mean when you add the contexts that his grandfather may not accept his identity? What do they mean when you consider he is now vegan and has conflicted feeling about fishing as a whole now? 

Out of curiosity, I asked ChatGPT to "write me a character-driven story about a boy and his grandfather going lobster-catching". It was painfully average. One thing that I had considered it may imitate well was the technical jargon and slang around lobster catching, as a model about the technicality of the language itself. It didn't even do that well. It seemed to focus on the weather and surroundings, focusing on the golden sunrise and misty bay. Lots of stories and essays include beautiful descriptions of nature, they can be found everywhere, which is not to say they can't be powerful. This story seemed obsessed with them.

Part of this experiment was also to see how the LLM handled a character-driven story, as I wasn't sure if my dissatisfaction in the characters came from the nature of the kind of story being written, or limitations of the model. Now, I would say that it is the limitations of the model, possibly being avoided in Machine-Shaped Hand. The relationship between the boy and his grandfather is also bland. There is no personality to either character. There are fluffy scenes of grandpa showing the boy how to pull up a trap (with no interesting or specific dialogue of course). 

One could argue that I should be more specifc in my prompt, give the model something to work with. But at what point is this not the tool for the job. When should I just write the damn thing? Chaing imagines an infinite-precision text-to-image generatior being "something analogous to Photoshop with a purely textual interface". I could keep correcting the LLM, instructing it to add certain details, but it would be much easier to to add those details themselves?

I think this opens up some other questions though. What if I were to take this story, use it as a base, and completely rework it, ship of theseus style? I don't think this is how people are using these models, but this is still something to think about.

This being said, I think I agree with Michel's assessment more. I especially agree with him that "the piece rests entirely on the purple prose. There’s kinda nothing else". This is true for the story I generated and Machine-Shaped Hand. The prose itself should beautiful, but it fails to create this web of meaning that any good literature should.

I heavily disagree with Winterson's opinion to the point that I think it may be the result of her being misinformed on the innerworkings of AI technology. She calls AI "Alternative Intelligence", when I would consider it quite the opposite. As a technology essentially using an internet's worth of human output to determine the probability of a "correct" response, it would be better to call it "Average Intelligence". 



Here's the story I mentioned in my post. Read at your own risk:

**"The Last Trap"**

The old wooden dory creaked like it was complaining about being woken up so early. Gray mist rolled off the harbor, swallowing the little boat and the two figures inside it: a boy, skinny and wide-eyed, and his grandfather, all rough hands and wrinkled eyes that smiled even when his mouth didn't.

"You ever set a trap before, Cal?" Granddad asked, squinting into the fog.

Cal shook his head. His fingers fumbled over the rope coiled by his feet. "Only watched you do it."

Granddad gave a soft grunt, half approval, half the weight of all the things he wasn't saying. He pulled on the oars, his arms moving slow but steady, like the tide itself. Cal watched him row, memorizing the rhythm, the little flex of his wrists. Everything about Granddad seemed built from the sea — as if he'd hauled himself out of it decades ago and stayed because no one told him he couldn't.

They reached the first buoy, a battered red thing bobbing in the gray water. Granddad handed Cal the gaff.

"Hook it."

Cal leaned over, heart hammering. The hook slid once, twice, then finally caught. He hauled the buoy up, feeling the weight of the trap pull against him, heavy and stubborn.

"Good," Granddad said, voice low and easy. "Now pull."

Together they heaved the lobster trap up and over the side. It thunked onto the floorboards, dripping and clattering. Inside, a pair of lobsters clattered around, their claws banded shut.

Cal beamed.

"See?" Granddad said. "Ain't so bad."

They moved from trap to trap, a slow waltz across the hidden dance floor of the bay. Cal’s arms ached, but he didn't complain. He was proud of the blisters starting to form on his hands. Each one felt like a promise: a little more like Granddad, a little more like he belonged here.

When the traps were empty and baited again, Granddad let the boat drift. The mist had thinned, revealing the pale gold of morning just beginning to break over the water.

Granddad pulled out a battered thermos, unscrewed the lid, and poured two cups of coffee so weak it was almost clear. Cal accepted his cup without a word, mimicking the way Granddad cradled it in his big hands. It tasted awful — bitter and burnt — but he drank it anyway.

"You know," Granddad said after a long while, "this'll probably be my last season."

Cal almost dropped the cup.

"You’re quitting?" His voice cracked, half from the cold and half from the fear blooming in his chest.

Granddad shrugged. His face was hard to read, weathered and deep like an old map. "Takes a lot out of a man, hauling traps every day. Figured it's your turn now, if you want it."

Cal stared at the water, his mind racing. He thought about the early mornings, the salt-stung air, the aching muscles — and the way it felt to be here, part of something older and bigger than himself.

He thought about how, when he was little, he used to believe Granddad owned the ocean itself, that he could command the tides with just a lift of his oar.

"I want it," Cal said, voice steadier this time.

Granddad smiled — not a big smile, just a small, proud tug at the corner of his mouth. He reached into his jacket and pulled out a worn knife, the one he'd used to cut bait for as long as Cal could remember.

"Then you better have this," he said, pressing it into Cal’s palm.

Cal gripped it tight, feeling the rough warmth of Granddad’s hand around his for just a second longer than needed.

The mist was burning away now, and the sun set the waves to glittering.

In the boat, two generations sat side by side, rocking gently with the sea, ready to begin again.
