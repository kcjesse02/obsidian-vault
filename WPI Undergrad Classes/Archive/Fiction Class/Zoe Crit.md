Hi Zoe,

Your story was wonderful, so down-to-earth yet magical at the same time. I loves your main character, she felt so distinct and lively on the page. Her struggle of desiring to be anything but mundane was one that spoke to me. I particularly enjoyed some of the details you included, about Harry Potter, Crystal Magic, and that the main character used an online forum to find like-minded individuals. Again, it really gave me a sense of what kind of person she is.

Much of your story is comprised of your main character summarizing events in her life. While this does provide an opportunity for you to show of your main character's distict voice, it's still summary and a scene would be more compelling in these places. For example, the ending is almost all summary, which makes it feel especially abrupt. I would strech out the scene where the main character is walking with her dad and sees the rabbit. It would also benefit the story if you actually included the scene where she dreams of that rabbit. It could be a memory embedded in the scene with her father, or even a previous scene. 

Since scene's a divided by so much summary and your story is over such a long period of time, many parts of your story feel disconnected. I think it would be a good idea to associate a symbol everytime something magical happens, or even just when the main character has a dream where she sees the future. I think a good symbol would be the rabbit, since it appears in the final scene. I think this would also help the final scene feel less abrupt.

I think you have a lot of amazing material in this story, it just needs to be combined in the right way. I'm excited to see where you take this.
