How can we create a good design for our relational schema

For complex data with many dependancies?
- Functional Dependancies
- Normalization

### Normalization
a set of rules that systemically acheive good design

##### Insert Anomally!

##### Delete anomally

##### Update Anomally

- must be updated in multiple locations
- can lead to inconsistent data

The prof and student information are a functional dependancy
- find all dependancies between attributes
- identify keys
- minimize data loss when performing operations

the right hand side values are determined by the left hand values
- SSN -> Name, DOB, address
- CourseID -> title, numCredits

Essentially a candidate key!
- any key or super key of R determines other attributes of R

if they have the same $\alpha$ values, the $\beta$ values must also be the same.
