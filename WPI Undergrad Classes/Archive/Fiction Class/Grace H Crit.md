Hi Grace,

your story was well crafted and an enjoyable read! I especially love the movement of the piece. One thing I found interesting was how we see more dialogue between Julien and Emilia became more common as the piece moved on, and then it just stops all together when they finally break up.

There are a lot of sections where background information is explicityly revealed to us. Take this part in section 5: "Julien worked at a local newspaper as an editor and did not really feel like telling her boss what had happened. She continued to go into the office, barely there, getting her work done before going back to her apartment"(pg 2). I would love for this to become an interaction between Julien and her boss or maybe one of her coworkers while she is at work where they ask her what is up. This can allow for the reader to learn about her job and how this situation is affecting her work. You have allowed the reader to discover things for themselves previously in the piece, such as when you mention how Julien keeps looking back at the last text. I would love for this to become more widespread in your piece.

I enjoyed your story and am excited to see where you take it!
