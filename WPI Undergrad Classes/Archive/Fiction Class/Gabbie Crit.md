- More specific in general, what books did he read to his sister?

Hi Gabbie,

Your story was very interested. I thing the detached feeling in the writing was an apt choice It really mimics how Mina may be feeling about this traumatic situation. I enjoy the interactions between Mina and Ryu when he comes in at the end of the story. Ryu is such an interesting character on the page. I found him very engaging. I enjoy how the detached feeling seems to disippate a bit as their connection deepens and Mina finds something that teathers him to this world: "Mina is hit with the startling realization that Ryu is a little— a lot— like Aya used to be. Aya, who’d drag him around the neighborhood to explore and play."(pg 7). This made the ending all more gut-wrenching. 

One thing I would like to see more of is specific scenes. There is very limited dialogue in this piece. While I do think that detached feeling suits the story, I would love to see more specific descriptions and scenes including some of the other character from the other parts of his life. In fact, I might choose one distinct scene from his life after the accident to encapulate the missery he gets from that. It seems as though this story is about Mina's relationship with Ryu, so the main purpose of recounting what happens is to give the reader perspective. 

I enjoyed your story immensly and am excited to see where you take it!
