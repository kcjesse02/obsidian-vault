Turn ERDs into Relational schema
- all about primary Keys
- Use primary keys and foreign keys to represent relationship

# 7 Rules
1. One-to-one relationship
	1. PK from one is copied over as a Foreign Key to table
	2. ![[Screenshot 2023-09-18 at 2.24.47 PM.png]]
2. One-to-Many Relationship without Relationship Key
	3. link the one side to the many side table
	4. ![[Screenshot 2023-09-18 at 2.30.01 PM.png]]
3. One-to-Many Relationship with Relationship Key
	4. relationship maps to a separate table
	5. ![[Screenshot 2023-09-18 at 2.27.54 PM.png]]
4. One to Many with Recursive Relationship
	1. imagine a fucking linked list
	2. has key for the items id, and the next ones id
	3. 
5. Many to Many/Muti way
	1. maps to a new table
	2. take all PK from both tables
6. Weak Entity Sets
	1. relate to identifying set through one to many relationship
	2. key is Identifier Keys + any discriminators

7. Complex Attributes
	1. Composite: only include bottom level primitives
	2. Derived: map as is (you can enforce later using triggers)
8. ISA Relationships
	1. examples in Code Folder!
	2. Does not follow one to one rules
	3. Super class key is always the primary key
	4. ISA method: Relation for each entity set

	5. One Relation for All
		1. creates a lot of nulls - kind of evil
		2. ![[Screenshot 2023-09-18 at 2.43.14 PM.png]]
	6. Relation for each subclass
		1. used for only distinct
	7. Relation for each combination
		1. Used for overlapping
		2. its factorial
