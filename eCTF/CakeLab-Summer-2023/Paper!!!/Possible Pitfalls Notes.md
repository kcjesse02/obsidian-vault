### Pitfall Questions:  
- What is an example of this from the competition? 
- Which teams suffered from this?  
- Why does this occur?  
- Is this problem likely to appear in practice?  
- How did teams solve this problem?  
- What are other potential solutions?  
- Are these solutions likely in practice?

### Entropy Sources for PRNG
- https://paperpile.com/shared/ECAaxs
- Extract sources of randomness from the environment
- Bad example: us
- Good Example: CMU; temp sensor on the 
- Why might this be so difficult?
	- systems don't require 

### Code Review
- the uart-readline bug was present in many team's code
- This bug was pretty obvious buffer overflow
- specifically: 
- 
### Effects of time constraints
- Time constraints effect all projects in software development
- Are the time constraints
