- A simple grammar
- Find the simplest rules that can capture a CFL

#### Rules
- epsilon rules are allowed only for the start S-> $\epsilon$
- change var to concatonation of vars not including S A -> BC
- variable to single terminal A->a

**Any CFL is generated by a grammar in Chomsky Normal Form**
1. Add new Start variable
2. Remove epsilon moves that are not involved with the start state
	1. New rules where A is removed
	2. for all possible ways to remove A
$R \to uAvAw$
$R \to uvAw$
$R \to uAvw$
$R \to uvw$
3. Get rid of unit rules: $A \to B$
	1. convert directly to terminal character of there is a chain
	2. $A\to B$ , $B \to u$ becomes $A \to u$
4. Consider arbitrary rules
	1. break into shorter variables of length 2
$A \to u_{1}u_{2}...u_{k}$
converted to
$A \to u_{1}A_1$
$A_{1}\to u_{2}A_{2}$
...
$A_{k-1} \to u_{k}$
	2. replace all variables with associated terminal


## Prove Context Free Language
- Some languages are not context-free
- use of pidgeon-hole principle

- Not closed under complement
- Not closed under intersection

- Equivalent to Pushdown Automaton
	- Automaton with a Stack!
	- Useful to prove that languages are not context free
