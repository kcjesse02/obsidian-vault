**Weak Entity Set**: does not have its own primary key
- attributes are not enough to form a primary key
- so, it depends on an external table
- a partial key is called a **Discriminator** 
	- dashed underline
- weak entity sets can have other strong relationships

ex: course number is only unique within the department, we need the name of department to make a key

**Identifying Entity Set**: the entity set from which a weak entity set obtains attributes to create a key.
- Weak relationship is a one-many from weak to identifying entity.

- contract must always be connected to a Supplier, a Product, and a Consumer
- sName, pName, and cName are underlined because they are the primary keys for

- if you can, give the entity-set its own primary key, but sometimes you can't
	- but sometimes you can't
	- competitors will not create a primary key system so everyone can veiw each other's data

# Inheritance
- Entity Sets share some common attributes but differ in some other attributes
	- ex: UnderGrad and Grad are both student

- it is useful to design "top down"

### Constraints
- Membership: Which set does it belong to?
- Overlapping: can it be part of multiple subclasses?
	- Disjoint: can only be a freshman, sophomore, junior, or senior
	- Overlapping: A student can also be an employee (under entity set person)
- Completeness
	- total: has to belong to one of the lower level entity sets
	- partial: does not have to belong

why is it partial?
- does not have to be cartoon or mystery
why is it overlapping
- can be a cartoon and murder mystery
- Scooby doo!
