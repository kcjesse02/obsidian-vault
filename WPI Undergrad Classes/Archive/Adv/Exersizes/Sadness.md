One Sunday in February, a man came to my door and asked "would you like to adopt this sadness?

"Life has been getting a whole lot better for me and I can't afford to feed him anymore"

I nodded. I congratulated him for whatever coincidental or earned success had lead to his newfound contentment. I thanked him for his consideration and said I would give his friend a good home.

The sadness was runty, so underfed you could count his ribs under his layer of skin webbed over his green veins like vines climbing up some old wall. He barred his teeth, shone his claws. But the man nudged him through my doorframe.

"His name is Sparky" He said. And then he politely signaled departure and walked down my driveway.

The dull grey monotony I had expected already arrived when I shut the door. The sadness had scurried underneath the shoe rack, next to the abandoned summer sandals.

I abandoned him for now, floated to the kitchen at the end of the hall to make a meal for myself.

He rooted under the shoe rack, strong appendages warping the metal, pushing through the plaster wall, and splintering the floorboards. 

He grew strong and healthy. His tendrils crept up the sides of my hallway, knotted together like some strong cord. 

My house was heated only by a pellet stove in the kitchen and the tendrils reached towards it, fed by the nourishing heat and my toil. It grew more every day, sometimes by at least a foot. He developed more specific features. boney bristles sprouted from his outer branches. When It encased the overhead light in my living room, I could see dark structures chugging underneath the pink film of skin. He had a circulatory system. Oxygen-rich blood pumped through the strong coils. A pride I had never before been capable of bloomed deep within me.

Everyday, I would fill a pitcher with scorching water, and wash the tendrils. They purred. It sucked up the water.

As they grew thicker, it brought with it its own climate. The interior of my house became thick with steam, my own private rainforest. I breathed in desperate gulps now, my lungs parsing the oxygen from the water vapor, desperate to stave off drowning.

With it's climate came its own smell, like rotten food and soil. There was a tinge of something acidic in my house too now, something that burned my nostrils as I inhaled.

My Sister came to visit, as she did every Friday.

By that time, the sadness had encased the pellet stove, along with the pictures of family perched atop it. I no longer put fuel in it. It kept the house nice and humid. 

It spread in every room, smaller roots branching off from a central trunk-like structure. Now, the tendrils were so widespread and numerous that it would take me until the darkness of dusk set in to wash them all. They absorbed my perception of time, just as they did the buckets of water I gave them. I just knew I could feel a stronger pulse each day.

This is how my sister found me. Washing my sadness. Her knock on the door, ever the routine by this point, came as a surprise to me. It was muffled, obscured in the sound of my sadness' thrum of growth, like what a child must feel from inside the womb.

Her glasses fogged up when she walked into my humid dwelling. They obscured her eyes behind a white mist. She held an elegant hand up to her nose. 

I led her into the renovated kitchen, stepping onto the elastic flesh that coated the floors now, transformed in what I now realized was only a week. She cleared her glasses and I could see her eyes were puffy and red, the same red as my sadness. 

"Why would you let one of these things into your home?"

When I was young, my sister could fix any problem I had. Ever the scientist, she helped me with my math homework when I just kept spinning in circles looking for the answer. She kept our mother at bay when she was in one of her destructive rages, she even got suspended once for attacking some kids who had begun to pick on me. Her retaliation was always tinged in red, angry scrapes, streams of blood, sudden, loud noises. Seeing her cry like this was like watching her limbs creak and bend into impossible angles, or watching her swallow her own tongue.

"Don't call him a thing," I said. "His name is Sparky."



Something beautiful happened. It rained inside my house. It intensified the acidic, rotten flesh and decaying plant smell I had grown used to, with a dull touch of blood revealed with this stunning conclusion. The rain had the texture of old dishwater. It coated my skin with a grainy film that I knew wouldn't wash out with water. It was hotter than any other rain I had experienced, stinging as it made contact with my skin. The rain fell in heavy streams, crashing on the floor and gathering in discolored puddles. 

My sister would say storms like this were "a healthy rain". A rain that fell in thick sheets. It originated from strong and healthy clouds. A rain that felt like a release to building tension within the world

I congratulated my saddness, by name, for his healthy rain.
