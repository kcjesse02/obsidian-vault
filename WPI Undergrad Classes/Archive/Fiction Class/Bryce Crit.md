Hi Bryce,

I love how down-to-earth your story felt. Your main character has a very distict voice that was very enjoyable to read. It really revealed his personality Even though this story dealt with a rather serious subject matter, your main character had me chuckling at some points: "Uh-oh, I thought. This is no bueno."(pg 2). I think this is what I enjoyed most about your story.

One thing that disengaged me as I was reading was the heavy reliance on summary. The story doesn't get into an actual scene until the bottom half of the first page. It may be a good idea to open the story with a scene where the main character is talking to his father about drug use. This would allow you to reveal the main character's initial situation through their dialogue rather than explanation. Your overall story had a lot of summary. I think this is a normal occurance when you strech a short story over a long period of time. I've found that one way to mitigate this is to choose one or two scenes to be associated with each time period, again, so you can reveal the changeges in the main charcter through dialogue, thoughts, and actions rather than summary. This would also give you more opportunites to let you main characters genuine and funny voice come through.

I enjoyed reading your story and I am excited to see where you take it!
