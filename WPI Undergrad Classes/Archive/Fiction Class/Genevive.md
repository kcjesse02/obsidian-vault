Hi Gennavieve,

I love how you start out your piece immediately in engaging dialogue. When we learn that the POV character is listening in on a conversation that isn't meant for her, the reader is drawn in further to the drama. This piece seems built around scenes involving dialogue, which is a very strong foundation and does the piece well. Your dialogue is well crafted and feels natural. Take this

However, I feel like the descriptions, and the writing outside dialogue felt a little monotone and objective. It felt out of place for a story so centered around relationships and human interaction. I would love to see some more playful metaphors and playing with language, especially in the scenes where your characters are planning and executing the big plan. 

The ending also felt strange to me. I like the themes of forgiveness, but it feels misplaces. It is revealed in the middle of the story that Jeremy cheated on Suzanne and consistently is possessive over her throughout the story. At least to me, this ending felt strange and unsatisfying. This might not be how you intended the ending to be interpreted and I would love to hear more about what your intended meaning was.

I enjoyed your story thouroughly. You are so incredibly talented with dialogue!!
