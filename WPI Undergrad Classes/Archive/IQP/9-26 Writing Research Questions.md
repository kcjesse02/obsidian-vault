**How do we find out research info about Workdays design philosophy**
- Yunus: 
	- look at workdays website
		- the website is an artefact
		- people try to be coherent, so there is information underlying it
		- get a sense of how they see themselves
		- comanies do not think about design, they think about products
		- design philosophy is implicit
	- Go interview workday people
		- thats a whole thing
		- usually interview fired people, they will give you the info
	- you can construct a design philosophy
		- find components
		- the pieces will give you a sense of the whole
- Identify 5-6 parameters (usability, ) to ask workday people about it
- Don't make a moral judgement about the design values
	- keep an eye out for contradiction between values and actual functionality
- Note about peer review: match the source with the claim

**Perception of the difference**
- ask people how they remember
	- people remember a romanticized view of the past!

**Research Questions**
- avoid questions that need ground-truth comparison to the past to answer
- focus on finding what *is*
- Does workday measure up to its own goals?
- How could this have been designed in a different way?

**Narrowing Down to a goal + research questions**
- brainstorm at the goal level, not at the building level
- make a biiiiggg list
