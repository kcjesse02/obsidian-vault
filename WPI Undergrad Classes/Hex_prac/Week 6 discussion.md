hex's editors are committed to seeking out and publishing diverse voices, promoting work by BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ writers and writers with disabilities, and nominating their work for year-end prize consideration. We believe it is each journal's moral imperative to do this, to widen the big tent of literature so there is room for voices that have been excluded, not due to quality of work but due to longstanding structures that reinforce lack of diversity.

Let's say you're editor at a journal, and you notice that your Submittable queue isn't diverse. Assuming you share hex's commitment to seeking out and publishing diverse voices, how might you address this situation? What concrete steps might you take to ensure you are getting submissions that better represent the whole of the literary community? Look in the articles for possible guidance, and offer some ideas of your own. 

Form an argument. Support your claims with evidence from the texts. Be specific.

I think the first thing I would do is ensure that I was soliciting submissions from a diverse set of writers. Jenny Zhang mentions this as a solution to this sort of situation: "Was that shitty? Yeah. It was. But so was not soliciting or finding actual writers of color to include in the book". For example, maybe this is a new literary magazine and submissions are highly based on solicitations of writers in the editors' networks. Maybe my network doesn't have a lot of diverse writers. Reach out to your network again and have them reach out to 

It might be worth reaching out to groups outside your network. There are a lot of workshops or writers groups specifically for BIPOC and queer writers who you could ask to tell their members about this new journal. You could reach out to other journals that are specifically targeted to specific groups of people and ask them to promote your call for submissions on social media.

These solutions require connection with other members of the literary scene. Social media may be the easiest way to do this. Ensure that you have a diverse set of people following you and you are following a diverse set of. This will help you build a diverse network.

Social media can also be a good way to keep updated on public opinion of your journal. Maybe your journal has a reputation for not accepting people from a certain group of people, or maybe accusations about a member of your staff. while people will always complain about things on the internet, its good to be able to tell what is simply people talking shit on the internet and what is someone sharing their genuine experience with your journal. You can use that information to inform future decisions, such as to let a staff member go or remove a piece from your journal website.

Failing these options, I think it would be best to bring on another editor or two who has a different background or set of beliefs. This fresh perspective will allow for submissions to be seen in a different light. This new staff member may see things that you could not and convince you to include a piece that you normally wouldn't have.
