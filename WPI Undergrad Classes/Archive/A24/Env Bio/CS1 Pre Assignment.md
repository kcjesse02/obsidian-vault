## The Biodiversity Crisis
https://serc.carleton.edu/s/integrate/biosphere/unit1_read.html

Biodiversity: the variety of life on earth
species diversity: the number of different species
genetic diversity: amount of genetic variation within a species
ecosystem diversity: number of different available types of habitats
range shifts: changes in where species are found
ecosystem processes: the way species interact with their environment

- Humans have caused the extinction of over 800 animal and plant species in just the last 500 years.
- called the "sixth mass extinction"
- humans do more than just kill things
	- they interact with their ecosystem at the expense of those they share it with
	- cause range shifts
	- change things like migration for birds
	- change behavior of animals
	- season cycles for plants affected by global warming
- lack of biodiversity begets more changes that decrease biodiversity.
- Fossil Record and previous mass extinctions
	- End-Ordovician event, 445–440 million years ago, estimated 86% of species lost
	- Late Devonian event, 375–359 million years ago, estimated 75% of species lost
	- End-Permian event, 251 million years ago, estimated 96% of species lost
	- End-Triassic event, 200 million years ago, estimated 80% of species lost
	- End-Cretaceous event, 65 million years ago, estimated 76% of species lost
- current extinction
	- ice age
		- megafaunal life lost upon human arrival to different places
	- habitat loss causes a lot of current extinctions
		- deforestation
		- ocean warming
		- increase ocean acidity
	- introduction of invasive species
