Many of the most popular database softwares use relational databases

## Attributes
- Name needs to be unique
- Domain: similar to the data type (valid values for the data)
- Must be atomic: representing only a single value
- *null* is a member of every domain, meaning we don't know the value

## Schema
- structure of a relations
- can be represented with relational tables
	- (a1, A2, ... A3) relation of R
	- Customers(Name, Age, amount of money extracted)
- Instance is the current schema of the data
- *Degree*: number of attributes(col) of a relation
- *Cardinality*: number of tuples
- **Instance**: a Schema, but with the current tuples (entries) included
## Relations are Unordered
- think of as a set rather than an array


# Keys of Relations
- *Super Keys*: attributes that uniquely identify each tuple
	- a student ID!!
	- a wpi email!!
	- phone number
- *Candidate Keys*: minimal super key
	- attribute that can be a super key by itself
- *Primary Keys*: a candidate key chosen to use in the program to uniquely identify tuples
	- can't have duplicates if you have a primary keys
	- What if there are multiple items we want to be unique??
		- specify other keys with the keyword `UNIQUE`.


## SQL Language
- create table
	- specify columns and their data types
	- specify primary key and candidate keys
- drop table
	- delete
- alter table
	- alter table
- describe

create table
```sql
create table Student (
	sID char(20)
	sname char(20)
	gpa number(3, 1)
);
```

### Datatypes
- char(n) - fixed length string
- varchar2(n) - variable length strings
	- n is the max length
- number()
	- number(n) - n number of digits
	- number(n, m) - n number of digits, m after the decimal point
	- if you try to enter a value with more digits before the decimal point, it will fail
	- after the decimal point, it will 
- date()
- no booleans, use number(1) or char(1)

### Some info about how number() works

## Sequences
- used to create unique data (like a student id)

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE sequence_name  
[START WITH starting_integer]  
[INCREMENT BY increment_integer]  
[{MAXVALUE maximum_integer | NOMAXVALUE}]  
[{MINVALUE minimum_integer | NOMINVALUE}]  
[{CYCLE|NOCYCLE}]
```
