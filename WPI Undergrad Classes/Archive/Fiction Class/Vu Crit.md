Hi Vu,

This story was so funny. I love how you slowly included details that led the reader to discover that Dan has turned into a dog: "Looking down at his toes, there were no longer toes but rather paws with sharp claws. His arms were shorter, and Dan felt like his body had lengthened when he realized he was walking on four legs."(pg 1). I love how it is revealed in the end that Sadie is his dog in the waking world.

One thing I noticed about the plot of this story is nothing really happens. Dan has a dream about becoming a dog and then he wakes up. While this is a humorus situation, I would enjoy if you fleshed out Sadie's actions as a human. What kind of person would his dog be like if she was a human?

I would also like to know how dan interacts with this situation differently from anyone else may react to this. He is weirded out and made uncomfotable by a lot of things that most people would be made uncomfotable by, such as having to eat dog food. I would love to learn about Dan's personality by learning what aspects of being a dog bother him specifically. 

Great job and I wish you luck in revision!
