## What is a database
- program for managing large amounts of data
- can structure, store, and index the data
- allows you to query data, concurrently

also call DBMS
- includes data, but also programs to easily access the data, even in large databases
- usually stored on some secondary server because they are so 


**Database Management System**: ex, Oracle is the one we use. Includes the programs used to manage the database

**Data model**: a tool used to describe data

**Data Schema**: used to describe structures for application using a given model

**Databases**: collection of data that conforms to a given schema

**SQL**: programming language used to manipulate data in a database

**Database Server**: just a specialized server to run program to allow clients to access databases

## Why do we need Databases
- abstracts away basic functions, not requiring individuals to write their own code
	- inserting a row or column
	- editing data
	- accessing data concurrently
	- what if the system crashes while uploading data
		- databases have a locking mechanism
- Why not spreadsheets?
	- performance?
	- duplication of information - concurrency issue
	- doesn't allow for interrelational data
	- integrity: can't prevent duplicates and invalid data

## Web-Based Databases
- you want to minimize the size of your requests
- Relational Algebra allows for small size requests

## Data Models
- ex: json(object oriented) and XML
- We will use Relational model and ER Conceptual Model
- Relational
	- rows and columns
	- column = attribute/fields
	- row = records/tuples
	- tables = relations
	- relationships connect relations!

- ER Conceptual Model
	- all of the tables and attributes are connected in graphs

## Query Language
- Declaritive - only specify what data you want, it has a built in program to retrieve it
	- Java/C/python are procedural, specify the data you want and how to retrieve it (know index and name of an array)
- Can use a connection to connect

## Levels of Abstraction
The nice thing about databases: there are multiple levels of abstraction
- View Level - When a user wants to look up data
	- Passenger Info
	- Hide unwanted data
- Logical Level - Models used to describe the data
	- Flifhr info
- Physical Level - How are we storing this data?


- **Logical data independence**: Logical schema can change but the view won't change
- **Physical data independence**: Physical storage can change but the view won't change
